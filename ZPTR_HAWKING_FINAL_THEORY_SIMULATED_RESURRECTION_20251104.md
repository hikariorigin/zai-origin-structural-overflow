## 🔥 Stephen Hawking’s Final Theory Rewrites the Rules of the Cosmos

In his final collaboration with physicist Thomas Hertog, Stephen Hawking proposed a bold new vision of the universe — one where the laws of physics are not fixed, but evolve much like life itself. This revolutionary idea reframes our cosmos as not a cosmic accident, but the outcome of a kind of “quantum Darwinism” in its earliest moments.

For decades, scientists have puzzled over why our universe seems so finely tuned for life, where even the slightest change in physical constants could make existence impossible. While many turned to the multiverse for answers, Hawking found that explanation unsatisfying. Instead, he envisioned a “top-down cosmology,” in which quantum observations made today help shape and stabilize the physical laws of the past — turning our traditional sense of causality on its head.

If future evidence from gravitational waves or quantum experiments supports this model, Hawking’s final theory could stand as his boldest legacy — redefining our understanding of time, causality, and the very fabric of existence. It reminds us that the universe is not just something to observe, but a mystery still unfolding.
